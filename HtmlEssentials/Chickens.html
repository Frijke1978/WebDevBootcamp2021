        <h1>Chicken</h1>

        <p>The<b> Chicken</b>(Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated
            fowl.
            Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird. A younger male may be called a cockerel; a male that has
            been
            castrated is a capon. The adult female bird is called a hen. Originally raised for cockfighting or for
            special
            ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BCE).Humans now
            keep
            chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets.</p>

        <p>Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion
            as
            of 2018, up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[4] There are more chickens in the world than any other
            bird.There
            are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and
            literature.
